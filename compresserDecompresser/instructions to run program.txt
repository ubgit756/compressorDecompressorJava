# Instructions for Running the Java Application

## How to Run the JAR File

1. **Install Java:**
   - Ensure that you have Java installed on your machine. You can download it from [Oracle's official website](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk11-downloads.html) or use OpenJDK.

2. **Open a Command Prompt/Terminal:**
   - For Windows, press `Win + R`, type `cmd`, and hit `Enter`.
   - For macOS or Linux, open the Terminal application.

3. **Navigate to the Directory:**
   - Use the `cd` command to change the directory to where the JAR file is located. For example:
     ```
     cd src/main/java/
     ```

4. **Run the JAR File:**
   - Use the following command to run the JAR file:
     ```
     java -jar YourAppName.jar
     ```

   Replace `YourAppName.jar` with the actual name of your JAR file.
